# V-Sona

V-Sona is a Discord bot for communicating server status and managing community roles.
It is based on the [Nostrum framework](https://github.com/Kraigie/nostrum) for Discord.

It is still in development and tokens and channel ids must currently be hardcoded in config.exs

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `vsona` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [

  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
